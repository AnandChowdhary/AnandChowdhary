# Life

This page has a yearly summary of my life.

## 2020

I spent January at home in New Delhi and then went back to Enschede to finish the last semester of my bachelor's. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, my classes switched to online-only, so I came back to India in March. In March–April, I helped start Karuna 2020, a nonprofit initiative to help migrant workers sustain during the lockdown. We ended up helping feed over 10,000 people in Delhi–NCR by distributing dry ration kits, and also gave away over 100,000 masks to healthcare and other frontline workers. Apart from that, I continued working on my bachelor thesis entitled "Email-based Intelligent Virtual Assistant (EIVA)", for which I also built a companion web app under Dr. Job Zwiers and Florian Overkamp from Speakup. I also experimented with the idea of starting a podcast (called Cofuturology) with my profession Dr. Jeffery White, but we decided to drop it after recording the first three episodes.

I graduated after receiving a grade of 9/10 on my thesis, and started working full-time on Koj, an interior design and furniture subscription company that I co-founded with Carlo Badini, on July 1. Carlo and I spent the next few months figuring out the business model and working on our core tech. In my free time, I continued working on open-source projects, including Upptime, a uptime monitor and status page that received 2,000+ stars on GitHub in under a week. In August, my parents, my brother, and I moved to an apartment nextdoor; and in September, my dad and brother got the coronavirus, so we were in lockdown mode for the month. In November, Sukriti got accepted to the MA program at the University of Groningen, so I applied for my orientation year visa and started looking for apartments there.
